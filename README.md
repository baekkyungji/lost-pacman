## Synopsis
Pacman got lost in his labyrinth. Go through the maze collecting white balls and getting score before you rescue him.

Beware of phantoms! they are relentless...

## Context
This is my first contact with VR. With a simple idea (like maze) it's possible to investigate the power of A-Frame library.

js13k compo was the best excuse to try it!

## Requirements
I have tested it in desktop navigators google chrome and mozilla firefox.

In mobile it is working great with iPhone 7 and safari.
